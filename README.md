# The CrackDown

## Introduction
The Crackdown is basically a repository on GitHub which hosts tool VRV, our very own created tool to detect whether a given site is a phishing site or not. VRV integrates two models. The first model follows the approach of using open source tools followed  by a second model which incorporates Machine Learning.

## VRV
VRV is a tool that will be used to tell whether the URL under consideration is a Phishing or a Non- Phishing one.
The tool will be working two models.
The first model follows the approach of using open source tools followed  by a second model which incorporates Machine Learning.
Machine learning model incorporates various classifiers that will be later used to enhance the probability and accuracy of the tool.
Later, both the models will be combined to generate the final output to tell whether the URL under consideration is a Phishing URL or a Genuine one.
